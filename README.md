# rio-blogger-app-ui
This will be the repository for the Rio blogger app I am making for SWDV 691

OVERVIEW
As a frequent traveler to Rio de Janeiro, I know most of the places to visit. Some Americans come with no game plan. All they know is that Rio has parties.  This is true, but Rio also has beaches, art, and culture. So how can a traveler explain their trip to friends or social media followers that plan on going on a  later date? What if travelers wanted to have a way to document their travel as they experience it?  Maybe a traveler wants to write a blog based on his/her experience?  This is where the blog builder comes into play!!!
GOALS
The goal of The Blog Builder is to build a web application that will allow travelers visiting Brazil to write in detailed information about a landmark or event in Rio de janeiro for blogs with just a few clicks.. 
The BlogBuilder could be used for YouTube bloggers to write in bullet points in order to lead them into a discussion for Youtube Videos.
